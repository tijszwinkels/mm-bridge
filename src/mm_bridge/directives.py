"""Parse assistant output for VibeDeck-style XML directives.

Supported directives:
    <openFile path="..." [line="..."] [follow="..."] />
    <leaveChannel [reason="..."] />

Directive regex mirrors VibeDeck's JS parser in
``VibeDeck/src/vibedeck/templates/static/js/commands.js``. Unlike the JS
side, this parser is markdown-fence-aware: directives appearing inside
triple-backtick fenced blocks or inline backtick code spans are treated
as documentation and left intact in the visible text.
