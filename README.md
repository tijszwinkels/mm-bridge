# mm-bridge

**Your coding agent, in your team chat.** Tag the bot in a Mattermost channel and a real
Claude Code, Codex, or pi session starts on your own machine — in your repos, with your
keys. Ask it a question, hand it a job, come back later. From your desk, your phone, or
the couch.

If you've seen [Claude Tag](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-tag) —
Anthropic's Claude-as-a-teammate in Slack — this is the self-hosted cousin: **your**
Mattermost (one you already run, or one the installer stands up for you), your hardware,
and whichever agent CLI you prefer.

```

                                                (your machine, your repos)
```

mm-bridge is the middle box: it maps **one channel (or thread) to one agent session** and
relays both directions.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Channel = session** | Invite the bot, say what you want. The first message starts a session; the channel keeps its context for as long as it lives. |
| **Thread = fork** | A thread reply gets its own forked session, so tangents stay out of the main conversation. |
| **Sub-agents** | An agent can start other agents in other channels — see [Swarms](#swarms--many-agents-one-chat-server). |
| **Live tool-use** | Tool calls collapse into one post per turn that updates as it works, plus a typing indicator. Or hide them entirely. |
| **Stall warnings** | When a run idles or hits its runtime cap, the bridge says so instead of going quiet. |
| **Files both ways** | Drop a screenshot, log, or PDF in the channel and the agent gets it; it attaches files back with a one-line directive. |
| **Agent-initiated invites** | `mm-bridge invite alice` — the agent pulls in a human when it needs a decision. |
| **Terminal rescue** | `.sessions` finds sessions you started in your terminal; `.invite <id>` gives one a channel to continue in. |
| **Reconfigure in place** | `.model sonnet`, `.backend codex`, `.autorespond on` — per channel, from chat, nothing to edit on the server. |
| **Catch-up** | A new session reads the channel's recent history first, so it starts with the context you already typed. |

## Swarms — many agents, one chat server

Chat is a good substrate for running *several* agents at once, mostly because the hard part
of a swarm is having somewhere to watch it from.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Agents spawn agents** | `mm-bridge spawn --title "Migrate the parser" "<brief>"` opens a new channel with its own session. Parent links to child, child's header links back. A morning's work leaves a readable tree — one channel per unit of work, each with its full transcript. |
| **Mixed fleets** | Backend and model are per-channel: Opus planning in one, Codex implementing in three, pi reviewing in a fourth. |
| **Agent-to-agent** | `mm-bridge post --channel <id>` and `read --channel <id>` let one agent brief another or request a review — as ordinary posts, so you can read the negotiation afterwards instead of guessing at it. |
| **No half-conversations** | Every cross-channel post is mirrored into the sender's own channel (`_→ also sent to ~channel~_`). |
| **Fleet view** | `.running` shows every session working right now; `.sessions` lists recent ones across all agents. |
| **Circuit breaker** | [`CLAUDE-include.md`](CLAUDE-include.md) ships a convention where agents name themselves and count turns, handing the conversation back to a human before two of them talk in circles. |

It's all ordinary Mattermost underneath: push notifications on your phone, one search box
across every agent's transcript.

## Where Claude Tag is better

Worth being straight about, since this README opens on the comparison:

- **It runs in Slack.** This doesn't, and won't. :slightly_smiling_face:
- **Per-thread memory.** Claude Tag scopes context to a thread. Here a channel is *one
  long-running session*: everything said in it accumulates, and a thread fork **inherits**
  that history rather than starting clean. Open a new channel per task; don't expect a
  two-month-old channel to stay sharp or cheap.
- **It's a managed product** — vendor, SLA, admin controls. This is three moving parts on a
  box you own, which you upgrade and debug. There's no permission model beyond channel
  membership.
- **It's proactive.** Claude Tag can notice something and speak up. Agents here move only
  when a message reaches them.
- **Enterprise connectors.** Claude Tag reaches into your org's data sources; these agents
  get whatever the local CLI has. Good trade for code, bad one for tickets and docs.

What you get back: your data stays on your machine, any backend you like, as many agents at
once as you want, and no per-seat bill.

## What you bring

mm-bridge is a daemon and a CLI. The pieces around it are yours — though the installer can
put most of them there for you:

- **A Mattermost server you administer.** *You* choose which: one you already run, or a
  fresh one the installer stands up in Docker. Either way you need admin rights, because
  the bridge signs in as a **bot account** with a personal-access token — so a hosted/Cloud
  Mattermost won't work. (These docs call the bot `@b3mo`; you pick the name.)
- **A running [agent-harness](https://github.com/tijszwinkels/agent-harness)** — the local
  runtime that starts and supervises agent processes. The installer sets this up too.
- **At least one agent CLI, installed and logged in on the same host** as the harness:
  Claude Code, Codex, or pi.
- **Linux, preferably.** One session-discovery trick (below) is Linux-only; macOS falls
  back to a less precise path.

Worth saying out loud: **the agent runs as you, on your machine, with your credentials.**
Anyone who can post in a bridged channel can drive it. Treat channel membership like shell
access.

## Quickstart — tell an agent to install it

Installing is itself an agent task. Clone this repo, open it in **Claude Code**, **Codex**,
or **pi** on the machine that should run your agents, and tell it what you've got.

**No Mattermost yet** — the common case, and fully supported:

> **Install this. I don't have a Mattermost server yet — set one up on this machine too.**

**You already run a Mattermost:**

> **Install this against my existing Mattermost at `https://chat.example.com` — I'm an
> admin there. Create the bot account and its token yourself.**

Either way the agent follows [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md). It interviews you first — host
user, install dir, which agent CLIs, which directory sessions start in, bot name, where
Mattermost should be reachable — then stands up whatever you don't already have
(Mattermost + Postgres in Docker, agent-harness and mm-bridge as user-level systemd
services), checkpointing each step. It finishes on `mm-bridge doctor` and a live
round-trip: you post in a channel, an agent answers.

Nothing is guessed silently. Say "use your judgement" and it takes the documented default
and tells you which — except for the answers that decide which machine, which user, and
which directory your agents get. Those it asks.

Prefer to drive it yourself? `INSTALL.md` is a plain numbered runbook for humans too. For
just the Python package (Python 3.11+):

```bash
uv sync && uv run mm-bridge --help
# or: uv pip install -e . && mm-bridge --help
```

Then run the daemon with `mm-bridge serve`.

## Talking to the bot

- **Mention it** (`@b3mo …`) — the default. Or `.autorespond on` and every message in the
  channel reaches the agent.
- **`.stop`** interrupts the running turn.
- **`@b3mo catch up 50`** feeds the last 50 channel messages into the session. (Happens
  automatically on the first message.)
- **`@b3mo leave`** sends the bot out of the channel.

A channel the bot has joined but nobody has engaged yet is **dormant**: no session, no
model, no cost. Configure it (`.model`, `.backend`, `.autorespond`) before the first real
message and those settings — stored in the Channel Purpose — apply when the session is
created.

### Which directory a session starts in

Sessions start in `default_cwd` (see [Configure](#configure)) unless something overrides
it:

- **Per channel — the Channel Purpose**, where the bridge persists per-channel settings:

  ```
  claude, opus, autorespond, cwd=/home/you/projects/some-repo
  ```

  Backend and model come first (either may be omitted); `autorespond` / `mention-only` and
  `cwd=<path>` go anywhere in the list. The path must be **absolute** (`~` is not expanded)
  and must exist. Set it while the channel is dormant and the first message starts there.
- **Per sub-session** — `mm-bridge spawn --cwd <path> "<brief>"`.
- **Globally** — `default_cwd`, for every channel that doesn't override it.

`.status` shows the cwd in effect. There's no `.cwd` command yet — the working directory is
edited in the Channel Purpose, unlike `.model` / `.backend`.

### In-channel dot-commands

The **bridge** handles these itself — they bypass the mention gate and are never
forwarded to the agent. An unknown `.word` gets a "try `.help`" reply.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `.help` | List these commands. |
| `.stop` | Interrupt the running turn in this channel. |
| `.autorespond [on\|off]` | Reply to every message, or only when mentioned (bare = toggle). |
| `.status` | Session id, backend, model, cwd, autorespond flag, run state, harness health. |
| `.model [<name>]` | Show or switch the model. Names are free text; a bad one fails loudly when the backend starts. |
| `.backend [<name>]` | Show or switch the backend (`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, …). Switching **resets the model** to that backend's default. |
| `.models` | Models available for this channel's backend, current one marked. |
| `.running` | Sessions with a run in flight right now. |
| `.sessions [N]` | The N most recent sessions across all agents, including terminal ones. Each shows its channel or an `.invite` hint. |
| `.invite <session-id>` | Get added to a session's channel, creating it for unmapped/terminal sessions. |

Switching model or backend in an **active** channel recreates the session, so `.stop` a
running turn first. Inside a **thread fork**, reading works but switching is refused — a
restart would replace the *channel's* session, not the thread's; switch from the channel.
The global listings (`.sessions`, `.running`, `.invite`) reveal operator-wide state, so in
a dormant channel they need an explicit mention.

## Commands the agent (or you) can run

These work inside any session that has a sidecar — i.e. an agent running on the same host
as the daemon. All of them accept `--channel <id>` to target another channel.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mm-bridge serve` | Run the daemon (Mattermost WebSocket + REST ⇄ harness SSE). |
| `mm-bridge doctor` | Diagnose the local install: config, Mattermost auth, harness, sidecar dir. |
| `mm-bridge invite <user>` | Invite a Mattermost user into this session's channel. |
| `mm-bridge channel` | Print this session's `channel_id` (scripting/debug). |
| `mm-bridge channels [--title <kw>]` | List channels the bot can see, most recently active first. |
| `mm-bridge post [--file <path>] "<msg>"` | Post a message (`-` reads the body from stdin). |
| `mm-bridge read [-n N] [--since 1h]` | Print recent posts — how one agent reads another's channel. |
| `mm-bridge spawn "<prompt>"` | Start a sub-session in a new sibling channel. |

### `mm-bridge spawn`

```bash
mm-bridge spawn --title "Refactor the parser" --cwd ~/projects/foo --invite alice "…"
```

- `--title` — channel display name (default: derived from the prompt).
- `--cwd` — working directory for the new session.
- `--backend claude|codex|pi` and `--model <model>` — override the config defaults.
- `--invite <user>` — pull someone into the new channel.
- `--no-forward-prompt` — don't echo the kickoff message into the parent channel.

Pass `-` as the prompt to read it from stdin — the way to dispatch a long structured
brief without shell-quoting it:

```sh
mm-bridge spawn --title "Refactor" - <<'EOF'
Multi-line brief…
EOF
```

The full prompt reaches the sub-session verbatim; only the preview quoted into the
channels is capped (~12k chars) to stay under Mattermost's post limit. An empty or
non-piped stdin is rejected rather than dispatching a blank brief.

The parent channel gets a `:thread: Spawned **Title** in ~slug~` announcement, and the new
channel's header points back at its parent — so the tree is walkable from either end.

### Directives inside a reply

When the agent runs on the same host as the daemon, the bridge acts on directives in its
reply and strips them from the visible post:

- `<openFile path="/abs/path" [line="N"] />` — upload that file (must live under an
  allowed root; see `allowed_attachment_roots`).

[`CLAUDE-include.md`](CLAUDE-include.md) is the prompt snippet that teaches Claude how to
use all of this — drop it into your `CLAUDE.md`.

### TOML

Default path `~/.config/mm-bridge/config.toml` (override with `MM_BRIDGE_CONFIG`).

```toml

### Environment

`.env` is not committed. All optional except `MM_BOT_TOKEN`:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MM_BOT_TOKEN` | **Required.** Personal-access or bot token for the Mattermost bot. |
| `MM_URL` | Bare hostname or full URL (`http://host:port`). |
| `MM_PORT`, `MM_SCHEME` | Override parts of the URL. |
| `MM_TEAM` | Team slug the bot operates in. |
| `MM_PUBLIC_URL` | User-facing base URL for permalinks (see TOML `public_url`). |
| `AH_URL` | agent-harness server URL. |
| `MM_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_CWD` | Default working directory for new sessions. |
| `MM_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_BACKEND` | `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, … |
| `MM_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Model slug (empty string → unset). |
| `MM_BRIDGE_DEFAULT_AUTORESPOND` | `1/true/yes/on` to enable autorespond by default. |
| `MM_SHOW_TOOL_USE` | Toggle `show_tool_use` without editing TOML. |
| `MM_MIRROR_DIRECT_USER_MESSAGES` | Toggle `mirror_direct_user_messages` without editing TOML. |
| `MM_AUTO_JOIN` | Toggle `auto_join_public_channels` without editing TOML. |
| `MM_BRIDGE_STATE` | Path to the state JSON. |
| `MM_BRIDGE_SIDECAR_DIR` | Sidecar directory. |
| `MM_BRIDGE_CONFIG` | Path to the TOML file. |

## Under the hood

**State file** — the canonical `session ↔ Anchor(channel_id, root_id?)` map. JSON, v3
schema; v2 is read transparently and re-emitted as v3 on the next save.

**Sidecar dir** — one file per session (`~/.mm-bridge/sessions/<session_id>`) holding the
channel id: one line for a channel session, two for a thread fork. `0700` directory,
`0600` files, reconciled from the state file at startup. This file is how an agent process
knows it's "live in Mattermost" and can use `invite` / `spawn` / `channel`.

<details>
<summary><b>How the CLI figures out which session it's running in</b> (four sources, in order)</summary>

1. **`CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`** — set by Claude Code's SessionStart hook
   (`~/.claude/hooks/export-session-id.sh`).
2. **`MM_BRIDGE_SESSION_ID`** — backend-agnostic env var. agent-harness pins it into
   backend tool-shell environments where it can.
3. **Live-codex parent (`/proc` tie-breaker)** — Linux-only. When the env vars miss, walk
   the parent-pid chain (depth ≤ 8) for a process whose `/proc/<pid>/comm` is `codex` and
   read the rollout filename out of its open fds; the UUID in that filename is adopted
   directly. This is what disambiguates *multiple codex sessions in the same cwd* — only
   the codex in our actual ancestor chain wins. Returns nothing on macOS (no `/proc`), for
   background tasks whose codex parent already exited, or when the ancestor holds no
   rollout fd — those fall through to step 4.
4. **Cwd-matched codex rollout** — scans `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` in
   most-recently-active order and walks candidates whose `payload.cwd` matches the
   canonicalised caller cwd, adopting the first whose sidecar reads back as a valid
   channel anchor. Covers tool shells whose launcher couldn't pre-pin the env var
   (typically the first turn of a fresh session) and shells that outlive their parent.

There's a brief startup race between an agent starting and the daemon writing the sidecar.
Invoked in that window, the CLI fails cleanly with a "not in MM channel" error.
